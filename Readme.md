I have been tasked by the CEO of an Italian footwear brand to conduct a competitor analysis, focusing primarily on pricing and the types of footwear offered. The goal is to help the brand maintain a competitive position in the market and identify opportunities to better meet customer needs.

My tasks include collecting detailed pricing information through web scraping for two brands: Melluso and DueLune. I performed the web scraping and data cleaning in the Jupyter Notebooks BW3_Melluso.ipynb and BW3_DueLune.ipynb for Melluso and DueLune, respectively.

Following data collection and cleaning, I conducted the analysis in Analysis.ipynb, examining various types of footwear such as sandals, boots, and high-heeled shoes. The analysis is broken down by company, category, subcategory, and sex.

I provided a comparative evaluation of the brandâ€™s products against its competitor, highlighting the number of models offered by category and subcategory, price differences, and product offerings based on sex.
