I have been tasked by the CEO of an Italian footwear brand to conduct a competitor analysis, focusing primarily on pricing and the types of footwear offered. The goal is to help the brand maintain a competitive position in the market and identify opportunities to better meet customer needs.

My tasks included collecting detailed pricing information through web scraping for two brands: Melluso and DueLune. 
I performed web scraping and data cleaning in the Jupyter Notebooks *BW3_Melluso.ipynb* and *BW3_DueLune.ipynb* for Melluso and DueLune, respectively.

Following data collection and cleaning, I conducted the analysis in *Analysis.ipynb*, examining various types of footwear such as sandals, boots, and high-heeled shoes. The analysis is broken down by company, category, subcategory, and sex.

I provided a comparative evaluation of the brandâ€™s products against its competitor, highlighting the number of models offered by category and subcategory, price differences, and product offerings based on sex.

I performed this analysis exclusively in Python. The following libraries were utilized:
* bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
* requests  
* unidecode
* pandas
* seaborn   
* matplotlib  
* numpy
